Data is recorded on notepad file format i.e. '.txt' on daily basis for 24 hours for different-2 devices like inverter, Energy meter etc. by the sensor.
Let say for the month of December, there is 31 notepad file each for inverter, Energy meter etc.
Analysing the monthly data, quarterly data, yearly data for different-different devices without using technical tools are complicated for the organization.
In this assignment, I have data of two devices for the month of December 2018 and January 2019.
No. of files for two devices for the month of December 2018 are 62 i.e. 31 for each device
No. of files for two devices for the month of January 2019 are 62 i.e. 31 for each device
Total no. of files for two devices for the month of December 2018 and Januray 2019 are 124 (62+62).
Now, I have 124 files in Notepad format and each file contains around 1000 rows and 50 columns
